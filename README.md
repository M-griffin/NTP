Nemesis Transfer Protocol (Win32, Linux, OS/2)
===

Nemesis Transfer Protocol (NTP) is a file transfer client / server set
used with BBS Programs in Windows, Linux, and OS/2.

The user would start up the user end (server) application.  Once
connected to the bbs, they would select to download with NTP protocol.
The bbs would then pass the Users IP address to the BBS client end which would
connect and transfer files directly to the end user.

NTP v1.10 (2004) is the latest Release.

NTP v2.00 (2004) is a prototype new front end what would also do outbound connections to share and send files to other users.
          This version is compatible with the v1.10 BBS client.
          
NTP was created when I was running IllusionBBS for DOS under the Gamesrv telnet server which had major issues transferring files.
This program was my first attempt at learning sockets and file transfers so that I could offer files to my BBS users.
It's a little rough but I'm sharing as maybe useful for others.

Feel free to use and modify.
